THE REASON D'ETRE OF PONG KOMBAT 2.  Forward by Stefan Gagne.

Being a poor student with little time or resources on my hands, I 
have little time to actually make games.  The stars aligned ONCE
for Pong Kombat 1, which was made as a class project so I would not 
fail AP Computer Science, and was released to the net for a few 
of my net.friends, figuring maybe six people would look at it.
30,000 e-mails and snail mail letters later the phenomenon had gone clearly 
out of my hands.  It was good and wonderful and all, but I was not gonna be 
able to hold up the dynasty (if there was to be one) any longer.  
So I put it on the shelf until such time that I'd have the resources and the
appropriately low level of sanity to take the paddle up again.

I didn't have to.  Ryan and his cohorts has the balls to make the bloody 
thing without asking me.  But instead of extreme violence on his personage,
I looked at the product and realized, yeah, this is pretty much in line
with the rampant silliness and parody of Pong Kombat.  So, why not?
Life is funny that way and these guys had the drive to do something special,
something relatively unique and certainly creative.  The universe deserved
another Pong Kombat game.

Ergo : this.  It's retroactively officially sanctioned by Gagne Software
(all one of us) and available for your entertainment.  It has begun.
But e-mail HIM, not ME!  Him!  HIM!! :)

		AND NOW, THE CREATIVE STUFF.  STORY AND PLOT

	Years have passed since the defeat of White Paddle at the 
annual Pong Lao Tournament and Swap Meet.  The victor, Green Paddle, 
famed archer with nothing better to do that day other than triumph
over evil, decided to retire to a life of writing.
Good for her.

	White Paddle didn't get off so easy.  His superiors were
Really Not Happy At All with his performance, and sent him to the
outer cult of Pong Lao to be judged.  But there...
something... happened.  He met up with... something... and that 
something gave him is soul... with... some catch... deliver the 
world... into... something's... hands... if... paddles... had..........
hands....................

	Ahem.  Enough spooky tension.

	Anyway, White cheerfully went about inviting/insisting/forcing
various paddles to come to a second tournament, with the goal of 
destroying them all because for some reason this would be very beneficial
to him.  He's hoping his newly hired second in command, the aptly named 
Chief Paddle, will just eat 'em for him so he doesn't have to do anything.
What a loser.

_________________________________________________

		ENOUGH ARTSY CRAP, HOW DO I PLAY?

	First, start the game.  This step is not optional.

	Enjoy the nice opening sequence, then you get an eye pleasing
menu of choices.  If you would like to see the story, wait a few seconds at
the start & options screen.
	If you wait for a few seconds, the story will come up.

	START - Start up a game of Pong Kombat 2
	OPTIONS - Browse various options to modify game play.

	If you pick options, you can Reboot the game (great for watching the 
title sequence over), Quit game, so you can get back to doing your real work.  So many choices!


	Whatever.  Once your ready to rock, Start a game.  You get a nice looking paddle 
selection screen.  The names of the paddle's are, clockwise from the top: 
White Paddle (Not playable), Aqua Paddle, Monolith, Green Paddle, 
Cyber Paddle, Bloodstone,  Rock Paddle, Spike Paddle, Shifter, and Magma Paddle.
Nine paddles in all, each have different characteristics (speed, weapons, yadda yadda.)


	If you wanna randomly pick a paddle, press Button 1 and Button 2 at the same 
time rapidly here.

			CONTROLS

	PLAYER 1 (1 Player mode & 2 player mode)
	
UP -    UP ARROW                                       
	
DOWN -  DOWN ARROW                               
	
LEFT -  LEFT ARROW                                    
       
RIGHT -   RIGHT ARROW                                  
	
BUTTON 1 -  SHIFT                                               
	
BUTTON 2 -  CTRL  


	If you want to reconfigure the controls for the keyboard, press
CTRL + Y.  Put the "X" on player 1 or 2 and a list will come up of the 
buttons you wish to change.  You can not change the config. for the joystick.
	
	
	If you play this game at your workplace or school classroom and your 
boss\teacher comes in, it F5 for the BOSS ACTIVATOR.  This will hide the
game.  When they leave, hit F5 again to bring back the game.
	
	To pause the game at any time, hit CTRL+P.
	
	Intuitive, no?  Once you pick your paddle, the game cycle begins
with your first opponent.  But before you actually get around to that thing 
where you bounce a ball around, there are seven boxes to look at the 
bottom of the VS. screen.  These are, as you probably guessed, good 
for unlocking secrets.  If you get the right combo of symbols in 'em,
mystical and cosmic things occur.

	The change the symbol in a box, hit the key corresponding to
the box you want to toggle.

	The first 3 safes are accessed by pressing 1, 2, or 3.  
The last 4 can be accessed by pressing 1, 2, 3, 4 on the right side 
of the keyboard. 


	The symbols are as follows, in accordance to number of times 
you gotta hit the button to shift to that image.  (This is similar
to the system in sequel three of That Other Game, for those familiar.)

	
	0- Peace, dude.
	1- PK2
	2- Question Mark
	3- Se7en
	4- Explanation Point
	5- PK1 (Ah. The classics.)
	6- Bomb
	7- Yin Yang.

	If you're sick of dealing with cryptic little codes and 
don't wanna bother, just hit enter and make your life easier.

	Now, it's the main event.  Mano a Mano.  Paddleo a Paddleo.  You
have a few things to keep track of: a life bar, your score, a timer, and
(obviously) your paddle.  Oh, and that ball thing.

	You lose all your life, you's dead and your opponent wins.  If your
opponent scores too much before you do, he wins.  Ouch.  It's a tough
world out there, but you can fight back by getting the ball past him,
nailing him with a special weapon, finding secrets, or performing a DISMANTLE.  
Lots of nice ways to win!

	Let's take them one at a time.  Getting the ball past is a fairly
obvious procedure.  Special are not.  Each paddle has weapons available;
what good brawl lacks them?  But launch a weapon you need to enter a Code,
or Special Move, or whatever you like to call it.  What is that code?  
Gotta find out, holmes.  But here's one you can practice with:  Monolith's
Star.  Hit DOWN, FORWARD, BACK, BUTTON 2 two times.  Wow!

	Next you have Dismantles.  Tricky, but oh so satisfying.  If you've 
beaten down your adverse lots and they're near death you might get a 
"DISMANTLE IT!" message.  Then... YES!  It's another secret combination
of key presses!  Man, didn't see that coming, did you?  Ahem.


	In the unfortunate event of your demise and the GAME OVER logo, you
have another chance.  If the timer runs out, both paddles are kick out of 
the meet.  It's... yes.  It's a code.  Don't look at me like that.  Pick 
'Enter Code' and you'll have two chances to hit a secret which will put
you back in the game in a big way.  Mind you, it costs one credit to do 
this, and you can't exactly insert tokens into A:.

	That's all there is to it.

                         BUGS & ERRORS

     Ah... bugs.  Bane of all programmers, foiler of fun.  We
think all the bugs are out of PK2, but if you find one, use the
contact information below and we'll do our best to squash it.

     Another version of PK2 is in the works, tentatively titled
Supreme PK2.  This should have anything cool we left out of this
version.  There is no set release date : it will be out when it
is done.  If you can't wait, go play Quake or something.

     If you're getting slowdown problems, it's probably because
your computer's too slow.  (Hence 'Slowdown.')  It might help to
free up some hard disk space for the virtual memory et all,
though.  The colors also need to be changed to 65536 or higher.
If they are not, we have found that the game is REALLY slow!

     If the graphics don't look very good, it may be because of
your video mode.  We designed the game with high quality HiColor
(65536 colors) in mind, and you should try running it in HiColor
or Truecolor mode.  If your video card isn't capable of it, this
isn't possible; but it's a good idea to upgrade your card to a 2
meg high color card anyway.  It really makes Netscape and other
'apps look much better, and lets you do some nice stuff.
	
	How do I use the joystick?  At anytime hit CTRL+Y.  Then put the "X"
on joystick.  If you want to reconfigure the controls for the keyboard, put
the "X" on player 1 or 2 and a list will come up of the buttons you wish to
change.  You can not change the config. for the joystick. 
	
	My joystick does not work.  It must have two buttons and has to be 
calibrated.  We tested the game with the "Gravis PC Game Pad."  It should
work perfectly with that.  Make sure the reverse and turbo switches are off.

If you lose or are about to lose, DO NOT bang on the key
board, or press all the buttons (arrow keys) really fast.
If you do this, we found that an error appears and you'll
have to reboot your computer.

     No, it doesn't work in DOS.  PK1 does, though.

---------------------------------------------------------------
                    LET'S MEET OUR CONTESTANTS

     All key sequences are the same for player 1 or player 2.

Aqua Paddle    She was created by White Paddle, when he got bored
               one day and had this genetics kit lying around. 
               Then she finds out her daddy wants to kind of take
               over the planet and kill everybody.  This isn't in
               line with her mode of thought, so she comes up
               with a simple, yet cunning plan : Kill him first.
                   


Monolith       Monolith once was White Paddle's right hand man,
               despite not being a man and the lack of arms on
               paddles.  He got a pink slip recently when White
               found someone he liked better, and has decided to
               get a little revenge on his old boss and his
               replacement by entering the tourney.
                   

Green Paddle   White made something of a mistake here, doing the
               classic villain thing of coming around town and
               killing all of the Hero's family.  (Heroine, in
               this case.  Yes, it's a female paddle.)  Green
               wasn't happy about this and decided to go get him
               in the next tournament.
                   

Cyber Paddle   A mysterious, robotic paddle whose programming
               seems to be 'Kill Shifter'.  You just can't argue
               with tight, efficient coding like that.  Not much
               else is known about him.
                    

Bloodstone     Even less is known about him except his ex-
               membership in the Pong Lao Cult.  Chicks dig a
               mysterious past, though.
               

Rock Paddle    Arising from the barren wastelands of New Jersey,
               Rock was invited personally by White.  His thirst
               for destruction is something even Gatorade can't
               quench, and his desire is to make all the world a
               barren wasteland.  Well, at least he has goals.
                   

Spike Paddle   Spike kind of gatecrashed the party.  Nobody
               invited him, but White admired his courage and
               decided to let him stay, despite Spike's
               intentions to kill White Paddle.
                  

Shifter        Once a hush-hush secret paddle in Pong Kombat 1
               and silent bodyguard of White Paddle, Shifter has
               crawled from his subtoilet sewer home to turn
               against White Paddle and restore his world back to
               normality.
                  


Magma Paddle   He was a normal, dull, everyday paddle.  Then
               White Paddle challenged him to a duel, and kicked
               his sorry behind into a volcano.  White didn't
               realize that the volcanic lava gave this paddle
               Phenomenal Powers and a serious grudge.  With this
               new identity, he enters the tournament to :
               surprise!  Kill White Paddle.
                   

Chief Paddle   Hand picked by White Paddle from Goons 'R Us,
               nothing is known about him.  Rumor has it he lost
               to White awhile back, though.

White Paddle   The leader of the pack.  He joined the Pong Lao
               cult and wiped out their leader, much to the
               cult's dismay.  He stupidly hosted the next Pong
               Lao Tournament and Swap Meet and had his paddle
               beaten in by Green Paddle.  The cult slapped his
               wrists and took away his soul, until... something
               claimed it.  Under this something's guidance, he
               has arisen once more.  Drat the luck.

Secret Paddles... who knows what lurks out there?
